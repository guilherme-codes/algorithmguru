### This project aims to explain complex topics through:
- ✨ Simple, no-jargon language  
- 🧠 Relatable analogies  
- 🛠️ Practical, hands-on examples  
- 💡 Visuals and structured layouts  

Whether you're just starting out or brushing up on your skills, this project will help you *actually understand* how algorithms and data structures work — and why they matter.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

### 🔍 Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step instructions that solve problems or perform tasks. In this section, you'll explore:
- What algorithms are
- How they work
- Classic examples like sorting, searching, and recursion
- When and why to use each one

### 🧱 Data Structures

Data structures are containers for organizing and storing data efficiently. You'll learn about:
- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables
- Real-world use cases and performance trade-offs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This site is built with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – React-based framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Utility-first CSS
- Responsive and accessible by default

## 💡 Inspiration

This project is inspired by the clarity and design of [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/), which explains topics like design patterns and SOLID principles in a visual and friendly way.

## 📌 Future Plans

- Add interactive code examples  
- Include beginner exercises and challenges  
- Add animations to visualize concepts
